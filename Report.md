# Tennis Agent
# Project's Goal

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

# Environment Details

The environment is based on Unity ML-agents. The project environment provided by Udacity is similar to the Tennis environment on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page.

    The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and 
    simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement 
    learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
This yields a single score for each episode.
The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.

In my implementation, I have chosen to solve the environment using the MADDPG algorithm. 

# Algorithm

The algorithm used in solving the environment is the Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). DDPG is an algorithm which learns a Q-function and a policy.

The algorithm image was taken from a Medium [article](https://medium.com/@amitpatel.gt/maddpg-91caa221d75e).

# Code Implementation

The code used here is derived from the MADDPG physical deception workspace from the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

The code is written in Python 3.6 and is relying on PyTorch 0.4.0 framework.

The code implements an Actor and Critic classes.

The Actor and Critic classes each implement a Target and a Local Neural Networks used for the training.

Instead of an Agent class, I created two actors. One for each agent. Both actors shared the same replay buffer and critic network. Both actors act on the state and contribute to the same replay buffer. They sample from that buffer when learning.

The algorithm and environment was very sensitive to noise. A low sigma and seed helped in learning.

Updating the agents networks after a set interval, as was done to solve the reacher environment, helped in steady learning.

#### Actor Neural Network
Input nodes (24) -> Fully Connected Layer (256 nodes, Relu activation) -> Fully Connected Layer (128 nodes, Relu activation) -> Fully Connected Layer (128 nodes, Relu activation) -> Ouput nodes (2, tanh activation)

#### Critic Neural Network
Input nodes (52) -> Fully Connected Layer (256 nodes, Relu activation) -> Fully Connected Layer (128 nodes, Relu activation) -> Fully Connected Layer (128 nodes, Relu activation) -> Ouput nodes (1)

# Results
Given the hyperparameters and neural network the agent was able to achieve an average reward of 0.5 in 2995 episodes.
